This is a Website made to help you better get an understanding of the Weather conditions in the areas you'd like to see.  Using this Site you'll be able to gather Weather-related Data from the Area of your Choice thanks to the Open Weather API (Linked Below).  You may also view the 5-Day Forecast of any area you'd like and your most recent search is saved with Local Storage, so you may go back at any point and click on it without having to search again.

When you first get to the Website you'll be able to enter in any city of your choice into the Search box to the far left of the screen.  Once you enter in a City you can hit search or Enter and your results will pop up on the screen (If it is not a valid city, you will get an error).  The Current Weather will be in the Center and right below you have the option to view the 5-Day Forecast which consists of the future 5 Day's Weather.  When you refresh your screen, the city you last searched will stay in your History just in case you'd like to quickly view it the next time you visit the site.
